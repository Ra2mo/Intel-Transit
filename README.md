The increasing complexity of urban transportation systems necessitates for an intelligent fleet management solution to enhance operational efficiency, minimize delays, and optimize routes. Intel Transit was developed as a Transport Management System (TMS) that integrated GPS tracking and real-time data analytics to monitor and manage vehicle fleets efficiently.
The project aimed to create a comprehensive fleet management platform that provided insights into route optimization, fuel consumption, vehicle maintenance, and driver performance. The system will enable businesses to track real-time fleet movements and generate automated reports. Key achievements included the implementation of dynamic report generation, PDF and Excel export functionality, and an interactive dashboard. Future enhancements were planned to incorporate AI-driven analytics for predictive maintenance and traffic-aware route adjustments.
By leveraging real-time data, Intel Transit improved logistics, reduced operational costs, and enhanced decision-making for transportation companies and urban mobility management.
